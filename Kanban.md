# Kanban board

It's a project management tool designed to help you visualize your work. Using cards, columns, and specific commitment and delivery points to help you understand how your work flows.

## Kanban Board Elements

What should you have on your board?

> Kanban method is largerly responsible for taking Kanban from a manufacturing process into software.

David Anderson, who popularized the Kanban Mehtod, defines five key elements:

- Visual signals (cards, stickies, or tickets). For agile teams you can think of these as one user story per card. Cards help teammates and stakeholders get a glance of what everyone is working on at ont time.

- Columns. Represent an specific activity that together compose a workflow. Workflows can be as simple as to do, in progress, and done.

> Back log. Customers and teammates put ideas for new projects.

- Commitment point. Is the moment when a team picks up one of those projects and work begins.

- Delivery point. Is the end of a Kanban team's workflow. 

> The time that it takes to get from the commitment point to the delivery point is called **lead time**.

- WIP limits. Are simple mechanisms to limit the number of cards in any one column at any one time.

## Personal Kanban

By Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria

There are only two rules: **visualize your work and limit work in progress.**

## Kanban vs. scrum board

- Scrum sprints have start and stop dates whereas Kanban is an ongoing process.

- ? Team roles are clearly defined in scrum, while Kanban has no formal roles. Teams are self-organized

- A Kanban board is used throughout the lifecycle of a project whereas a scrum board is cleared an recycled after each sprint.

- A scrum board has a set number of tasks and strict deadline to complete them.

- Kanban boards are more flexible with regards to tasks and timing. Tasks can be reprioritized, reassigned, or updated as needed.

# Goals for agile teams using WIP limits

- Size individual tasks consistently. When breaking down requirements and user stories, it's important to keep individual task to no more than 16 hours of work. **Doing so increases the team's ability to estimate confidently, and it helps prevent bottlenecks**.

- Map WIP limits to the team's skills. The above example assumes team members have similar skill sets. If your team has specialists on it, work in progress limits may differ when the specialist is involved. Create a status specific for the specialist's work. If bottlenecks occur in that status, use the opportunity to educate other team members to add additional capacity for the specialist's skill sets and increase flow across the entire team.

- Reduce idleness. When a team member has some downtime, encourage them to help an upstream or downstream team member.

- Protect a sustainable engineering culture. WIP limits are meant to support solid agile engineering practices that protect the quality of the product and health of the code base.

# Kanban vs. scrum

Kanban is a project management framework that relies on visual tasks to manage workflows, while scrum is a project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work though a set of values, principles, and practices.

Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting WIP, and maximizing efficiency (or flow).

Scrums teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback.

## Kanban 

Kanban is great for teams that have lots of incoming requests that vary in priority and size. Whereas scrum processes require high control over what is in scope, Kanban let's you go with the flow.

**RELEASE METHODOLOGY**

In kanban, updates are released whenever they are ready, without a regular schedule or predetermined due dates.

**KEY METRICS**

Lead time and cycle time are important metrics for Kanban teams.

? The Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) is another analytical tool used by Kanban teams to understand the number of work items in each state.

# Scrumban vs. Kanban vs. Scrum

Kanban aims to give team members just enough work so the team is consistently working at capacity. **Kanban is great for operational teams focused on continuos delivery with changing priorities**.

## What is Kanplan?

Atlassianâ€™s build engineering team is in charge of a platform used to build, test, and deliver Atlassian software. Developers depend on a reliable infrastructure and fast Continuous Integration (CI).

> *Four years ago this looked like 21,000 builds per month. Today this number exceeds 150,000 builds per month*.

This ability to scale can be attributed to team growth, moving from Subversion to Git, automated testing, and something less obvious: the decision to move from scrum to Kanban.

Kanplan is meant to bring you the best of both worlds. You can move cards around without having a sprint in progress and enter tasks in a backlog to help you plan better.

# Kanban cards

Kanban is a Japanese word that means "visual signal" or "signal board". Kanban cards were invented in the late 1940s by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota who was looking for ways to improve Toyota's manufacturing process.

## The purpose of kanban cards

- View important details about work items at a glance. Typically features a brief description of a work item, along with its owner, due date, and status.

- Hand off deliverables smoothly and efficiently. Kanban cards encourage teams to establish clear and consistent expectations for each functional area.

- Improve efficiency. Make it easy to keep track of lead time. Can help teams identify bottlenecks in their workflow and streamline their process.

## The benefits or kanban cards

- Kanban cards make it easy to detect inefficiencies.

- Kanban cards facilitate just-in-time delivery.

- Kanban cards encourage collaboration between teams.
